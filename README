DESCRIPTION:
This is a set of scripts that generates a bootable image (and/or ISO file),
that creates a working minimal installation of FreeBSD, that gets completely
loaded into memory.

The image may be written directly using dd(1) into any bootable block device,
e.g. a hard disk or a USB stick e.g. /dev/da0, or a bootable slice only, 
e.g. /dev/ad0s1

REQUIREMENTS:
 - FreeBSD 6 or higher installed, tested on i386 or amd64
 - Base and kernel from a FreeBSD 6 or 7 distribution
   (release or snapshots, e.g mounted CDROM disc1 or ISO file)
 - mkisofs from sysutils/cdrtools (optional) to create ISO images

INSTRUCTIONS:
 1. Read hints in the sample configuration files in the conf/ directory, copy
    these files to files without .sample ending and make modifications to suit 
    your needs

 2. If you want any packages installed, copy the .tbz files that should be 
    automatically installed into the packages/ directory
    WARNING: Your image should not exceed 45MB in total, otherwise kernel panic
             may occur on boot-time.

 3. Run the make command:
     - to create a bootable image:
      make BASE=/path/to/distribution 

     - to create a bootable ISO:
      make iso BASE=/path/to/distribution

     - to cleanup:
      make clean

     - example: make BASE=/cdrom/7.0-BETA2
